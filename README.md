## Getting Started
To get started with SSTools4MC, follow these steps:

1. Download the latest version of SSTools4MC from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/NGDPLNk/SSTools4MC/releases/latest) page.
2. Run the installer. A shortcut should be created on your desktop and in your Windows start menu.
3. Enjoy!

## Installation
### Minimum Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10 (64-bit - Version 10.0.14393.6796) or newer. Windows 10 22H2 recommended.
- Processor: 2 cores at 1.00GHz; x64 architecture.
- RAM: At least 1GB.
- Disk Space: Varies depending on the server.
- Python: 3.9 or newer.

Administrator privileges are also required in old releases of SSTools4MC to access server files and folders.

### Python Installation and Required Modules
1. Download and install Python 3.9 or newer from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/). When installing Python, be sure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option.
2. After you successfully installed Python with this option, open a command prompt, powershell or terminal with administrator privileges.
3. Install the required Python modules by running the following commands:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    pip install termcolor
    ```

### Java Installation
1. Download the Java 22 installer from the [official Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/cl/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk22-windows).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Java 22.
3. Verify the installation by opening a command prompt, powershell or terminal and running:
    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

If Java 22 is correctly installed, the command should display the installed Java version.

Java is necessary to your machine to be able to run your Minecraft servers.

## Build SSTools4MC Installer by yourself

Follow these steps to build the SSTools4MC installer from the source code by yourself.

### Clone this Repository

First, clone/download this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ngdplnk/SSTools4MC.git
```

### Install NSIS

You need to install the latest NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) version to build the installer. You can download it from [NSIS Official Website](https://nsis.sourceforge.io/Download). Be sure to follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Verify Files

Navigate to the `3 - launcher` folder in the cloned repository. Ensure that you have the following files (there may be more, but you need to have at least these):

- `build.nsi`
- `icon.ico`
- `launcher.pyw`

If any of these files are missing, please download them from the repository.

### Edit build.nsi File

Open the `build.nsi` file in a text editor and replace the placeholders `<TYPE THE ICON.ICO PATH HERE>` and `<TYPE THE LAUNCHER.PYW PATH HERE>` with the actual paths to your `icon.ico` and `launcher.pyw` files, respectively. Save the changes.

### Compile the Installer

1. Open NSIS.
2. Select the option "Compile NSIS Scripts".
3. Drag and drop the `build.nsi` file you just edited into the NSIS window.
4. An installer for the SSTools4MC program will be created.
5. Enjoy!
